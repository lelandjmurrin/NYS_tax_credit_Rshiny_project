    <h2>Additional Datasets</h2>
    <p>Use the other three datasets provided by the NYS Department of Taxation and Finance for 
        the predictions analysis: Credit Used, Taxation Basis and Master Credit Utilization </p>

    <h2>Model Improvement</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Enhance model performance through optimizing Lasso and Ridge regularization</li>
    <li>Utilize different transformations for the target than BoxCox</li>
    <li>Consider other Credit Types (Credit Claimed, Credit Used, Credit Carried Forward and Credit Refunded)
        in the dataset and finding a way to correct for redundancies </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Additional Information</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Join other datasets to see if we can create a master dataset based on joining on Tax Year, 
        Credit Name and Credit Type to display all grouping information in the same set</li>
    <li>Integrate other government website databases in order to enhance the results of the forecast (e.g. Number of Taxpayers)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Number of Taxpayers</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Determine a model for the Number of Taxpayers to predict the future number of taxpayers to make 
        more accurate predictions on the Average Amount of Credit Earned per Taxpayer</li>
    </ul>
