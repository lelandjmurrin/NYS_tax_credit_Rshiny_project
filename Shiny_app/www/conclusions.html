    <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p>The application presents the methodology behind determining the best model 
        for both income and industry for predicting New York State Article 9A Tax Credits earned by tax year. </p>
    <h2>Purpose:</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this application is to assist tax professional consultants 
        with the best tools for advising their clients.<br>This will help the customers make the 
        most appropriate current and future business decisions when considering possible tax credits.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusions:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>The industry model generates slightly more accurate predictions compared to the income model</li>
    <li>The data had to be transformed in order to overcome the abnormal distribution 
        of the amount of credit and privacy issues resulting in missing values </li>
    <li>The model explains approximately 70% of the variability in the test data</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Limitations:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>The model isn't extremely accurate, but can be used for signal comparison (Can we expect credit to go up or down across years?)</li>
    <li>There are some industries, income groups and credit names taken out by the 
        best model,<br>but those fields generally should remain at the same levels based 
        on Number of Taxpayers and Tax Year </li>
    <li>Credit Earned was considered over other Credit Types (e.g. Credit Carried Forward) 
        because they make the data more standardized (i.e. the Amount of Credit 
        doesn't accumulate accross years)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recommendations:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Analyze how clients tax credits earned under Article 9A compare to other
        income levels and industries
    </li>
    <li>Assist in identifying potential new clients based
        on industry and or income level
    </li>
    <li>Give a rough estimate of what clients should be earning in this tax year 
        and subsequent tax years
    </li>
    </ul>
