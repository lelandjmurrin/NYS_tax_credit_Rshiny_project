    <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p> This website presents the application and methodology for predicting the best estimate for Earned Tax Credit  
        for both income and industry for New York State Article 9A by tax year. </p>

    <h2>Conclusions:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>The industry model generates slightly more accurate predictions compared to the income model</li>
    <li>The data had to be transformed in order to overcome the abnormal distribution 
        of the amount of credit and privacy issues resulting in missing values </li>
    <li>The model explains approximately 70% of the variability in the test data when using a train/test split of 80:20</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Limitations:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>The model accuracy could be improved, but for now it can be used for signal comparison (Can we expect credit to go up or down across years?)</li>
    <li>There are some industries, income groups and credit names taken out by the 
        best model,<br>but those fields generally should remain at the same levels based 
        on Number of Taxpayers and Tax Year </li>
    <li>Credit Earned was considered over other Credit Types (e.g. Credit Carried Forward) 
        because they make the data more standardized (i.e. the Amount of Credit 
        doesn't accumulate across years)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recommendations:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Analyze how clients tax credits earned under Article 9A compare to other
        income levels and industries
    </li>
    <li>Assist in identifying potential new clients based
        on industry and or income level
    </li>
    <li>Give a rough estimate of what clients should be earning in this tax year 
        and subsequent tax years
    </li>
    </ul>
