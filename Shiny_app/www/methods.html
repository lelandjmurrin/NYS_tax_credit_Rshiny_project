    <p>These are the steps that were used to transform the raw data to a cleaned version that was used for the regression step in this model.</p>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Filtered 'Credit Type' field to only consider 'Credit Earned'</li>
    <li>Split the dataset into known Totals for each 'Credit Name' and other records</li>
    <li>Joined the two tables on 'Tax Year' and 'Credit Name'</li>
    <li>Filtered out any missing Total Values that prevent imputation</li>
    <li>For the missing values, calculated the average 'Number of Taxpayers' and average 'Amount of Credit' </li>
    <li>Imputed the average values into the missing values</li>
    <li>Calculated the average amount of credit earned per taxpayer ('Avg') and being careful not to divide by 0 </li>
    <li>The following columns were selected: 'Tax Year', 'Credit Name', 'Income/Industry Group', 'Number of Taxpayers', and 'Average Amount of Credit per Taxpayer'</li>
    </ol>
